% [Data,Time]=agw_filter(Data, Time, DataMin, DataMax)
%
% Function to threshold and adaptive Gaussian filter data that is a
% function of one variable (assumed to be time here but could be one
% spatial coordinate).
%
% Data  - Data matrix to be filtered - assumed to be a function of 1
%         variable and that dependence coincides with the longer dimension 
%         of thematrix, i.e., 3-components of velocity in 3 columns as a 
%         function of time in the rows which will be more than 3 rows long.  
%       - Note that the filtered version of Data is returned in Data to be
%         efficient with memory.  The calling code likely wants to store 
%         the returned data in a new variable - see provided test code,
% Time -  Vector of sample times (or spatial position in 1-D) and returned 
%         vector of filtered times (spatial locaitons). 
%       - Note that the filtered version of Time is returned in Time to be
%         efficient with memory.  The calling code likely wants to store 
%         the returned Time in a new variable - see provided test code,
% DataMax - Maximum allowable value in the data set
% DataMin - Minimum allowable value in the data set
%
% Note: Cowen encourages setting DataMin/DataMax as wide as possible, it is
% really there to remove non-physical spurious data - the AGW portion will 
% remove the rest.
